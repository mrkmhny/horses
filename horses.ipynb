    "## CSCA 5622 Final Project: Horse Colic Survival Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "Colic is a vetenary term that refers to abdominal pain in horses.  This is a potentially serious condition that could result in death for the animal.  The goal of this project is to create a machine learning classification model that can accurately predict whether a horse will survive or die, based on a number of factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why?\n",
    "On a personal level, I believe that healthcare is one of the most exciting areas of application for machine learning models, hence the motivation for this kind of project.  As we'll see below, the dataset we'll be using is an interesting balance of being both easily understandable, but not immediately obvious what the outcome will be.  From a self-learning perspective, I'll be happy if this exercise results in a model that predicts better than random chance, but I'm certain it will be a worthwhile exercise and practice in employeeing foundational ML techniques.\n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset we'll be using is from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.  It was donated in 1989.  This is a relatively small database, only 15KB zipped.  It contains 368 instances with 28 attributes/features (including continuous, discrete, and nominal values).  Below is a description of all provided features:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Age\n",
    "* 1 = Adult horse\n",
    "* 2 = Young (< 6 months)\n",

    "3. Hospital Number\n",
    "Numeric id. The case number assigned to the horse (may not be unique if the horse is treated > 1 time)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. rectal temperature\n",
    "Linear, in degrees celsius. An elevated temp may occur due to infection. Temperature may be reduced when the animal is in late shock. Normal temp is 37.8, this parameter will usually change as the problem progresses, eg. may start out normal, then become elevated because of the lesion, passing back through the normal range as the horse goes into shock\n",
    "\n",
    "5. pulse\n",
    "Linear. The heart rate in beats per minute is a reflection of the heart condition: 30 -40 is normal for adults rare to have a lower than normal rate although athletic horses may have a rate of 20-25, animals with painful lesions or suffering from circulatory shock may have an elevated heart rate\n",
    "\n",
    "6. respiratory rate\n",
    "Linear.  Normal rate is 8 to 10.  Usefulness is doubtful due to the great fluctuations\n",

    "According to uploader, this should NOT be treated as a ordered or discrete variable, but we will evaluate.\n",
    "In general, the more painful, the more likely it is to require surgery. Prior treatment of pain may mask the pain level to some extent\n",
    "\n",
    "12. peristalsis\n",
    "An indication of the activity in the horse's gut. As the gut becomes more distended or the horse becomes more toxic, the activity decreases\n",
