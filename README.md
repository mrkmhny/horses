## CSCA 5622 Final Project: Horse Colic Survival Rate

### Introduction
Colic is a vetenary term that refers to abdominal pain in horses.  This is a potentially serious condition that could result in death for the animal.  The goal of this project is to create a machine learning classification model that can accurately predict whether a horse will survive or die, based on a number of factors.

#### Why?
On a personal level, I believe that healthcare is one of the most exciting areas of application for machine learning models, hence the motivation for this kind of project.  As we'll see below, the dataset we'll be using is an interesting balance of being both easily understandable, but not immediately obvious what the outcome will be.  From a self-learning perspective, I'll be happy if this exercise results in a model that predicts better than random chance, but I'm certain it will be a worthwhile exercise and practice in employeeing foundational ML techniques.

The dataset we'll be using is from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.  It was donated in 1989.  This is a relatively small database, only 15KB zipped.  It contains 368 instances with 28 attributes/features (including continuous, discrete, and nominal values).  Below is a description of all provided features:
